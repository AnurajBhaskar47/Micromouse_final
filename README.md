# Micromouse_Maze Solver Simulator

This file contains all the final files & builds used for the micro mouse simulation in Technevince (Tech Exhibition of IIT Guwahati).

## This a Python-based micro mouse simulator

As the screenshot shows, the simulator has two parts in the workspace: the maze & code execution panel.
The users can test various algorithms in the simulator using either Python or C++ builds.

### An example picture of the Bellman-Ford algorithm is shown below:

### Users can define & test various maze solving algorithms here as an example I have used Bellman-ford Algorithm:

As visible, the entire maze grid is populated with cell distance (w.r.t to the center location). This describes the micro mouse's flood fill algorithm as it follows the path with the greedy approach of going to the next smallest value. The micro mouse must perform a complete graph traversal for this algorithm to function correctly, as shown in the video below.
